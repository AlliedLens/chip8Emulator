# Chip8 Emulator Built in C

## Description

Beginner to emulating tries his hand at building one of the most basic emulator/interpreter, for the chip8, which is a language that used to run on devices from the 80s, using C. Oh I almost forgot, trying to do this project without any chatgpt.

## Project Structure
As of now the project contains header files for the main definiton of the chip and its core functions, with utils having necessary things that arent a part of chip8 such as ROM loading, and others.
